2. **Receipt Upload:** Users can upload receipt images or PDFs through a simple interface.

3. **Data Extraction:** The application extracts key information from the receipts, such as vendor name, date, total amount, and line items.

4. **Data Storage:** Extracted data is stored in a structured format in a database for easy retrieval and analysis.

5. **API Endpoints:** Provides RESTful API endpoints for uploading receipts, retrieving processed data, and managing user accounts.

6. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling to manage invalid uploads, unsupported file formats, and other potential issues.
